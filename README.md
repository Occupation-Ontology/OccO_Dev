Development Repo for OccO Occupation Ontology

### Note: dev site version 1: 2/12//22  
The Occupation Ontology (OccO) is an ontology in the domain of human occupations. OccO standardizes and represented all the occupations defined in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) developed by the following US Federal agencies:
- Department of Labor 
- Bureau of Labor Statistics
- The O\*NET Program, the United States' primary source of occupational information. 

OccO reflects the data content of the **O\*Net-SOC 2019** taxonomy, and it is developed by following OBO Foundry principles. 

OccO is co-developed by Sam Smith and Oliver He, at the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 

OccO was initially developed as part of the Role Ontology (RoleO) as seen here in BioPortal: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ROLEO.
